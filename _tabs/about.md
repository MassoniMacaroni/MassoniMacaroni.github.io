## I’m Jono.

I’m a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) with a deep passion for the fascinating world of distributed computing, systems performance, and the underlying mechanics of how computers really work. My journey as an SRE has been one of constant learning, experimentation, and growth. Along the way, I’ve developed a particular interest in exploring the challenges of building scalable systems, solving performance bottlenecks, and understanding the intricate principles that make modern computing possible.

This blog serves as my personal space to document my thoughts, projects, and learnings as I navigate the ever-evolving field of SRE. Whether it’s dissecting the intricacies of distributed systems, delving into low-level computer science fundamentals, or tackling practical engineering problems, my goal is to not only share what I learn but also to foster discussions and connections with like-minded individuals.

### Why I started this blog
As an engineer, I’ve always found immense value in reading about others’ experiences, successes, and even failures. Technical blogs, open-source projects, and research papers have been my go-to resources for inspiration and problem-solving. Starting this blog is my way of improving my technical writing whilst also giving back to the tech community and contributing to the collective knowledge base.

I also view this blog as a journal—an opportunity to reflect on my own growth as I tackle new challenges. Writing about my experiences pushes me to think critically, solidify my understanding, and explore new ideas that I might otherwise overlook.

### What You’ll Find Here
What You’ll Find Here

This blog is a work in progress—just like me. As I continue to grow and develop my skills as an SRE, I’ll aim to tackle a range of topics that I’m passionate about or currently exploring, including:
* **Distributed Systems at Scale:** My attempts to understand and explain how large-scale systems are designed, built, and maintained.
* **Performance Engineering:** Sharing what I learn about optimizing systems for speed, efficiency, and reliability—sometimes through trial and error.
* **Computer Science Fundamentals:** Revisiting core principles and breaking them down as I deepen my understanding of how computers truly work.
* **Tools and Techniques:** Highlighting tools, scripts, and methods I’ve found useful in my day-to-day work as an SRE.
* **Personal Projects and Experiments:** Documenting the challenges, successes, and occasional failures I encounter while working on hands-on projects.

This isn’t a space where you’ll find definitive guides or perfect answers (at least, not yet). Instead, you can expect honest reflections, evolving ideas, and the occasional detour as I build my knowledge and experience. My hope is that, by sharing my process and progress, I can help others on similar journeys—or at least provide some food for thought.

### Let's Connect
Engineering is a team sport, and I’d love to hear from you. Feel free to share your thoughts, ideas, or even critiques in the comments or reach out to me directly. Collaboration and knowledge-sharing are what make our field so rewarding, and I’m excited to learn from the broader community just as much as I hope to contribute.
