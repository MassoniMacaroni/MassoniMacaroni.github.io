I've always had a passion for learning and working in a team and recently one of my favourite ways to pick new things up has been reading technical books. Whether its learning new concepts or new ways to approach old problems I've found I actulaly quite enjoy them but unfortunately my partner isn't in love with me rambling about the differences betweren concurrency and parrellism... so I need another outlet. I haven't really ever contributed to any discussions about books probably since I did english in school, but I figured I try something new and see if I could start a book club at work.

### What should a book club be?
To start with I want to outline a few things about my ideal expectations of the book club I'm going to attempt to create. I'd like the goal of the book club to be creating a pressure free social learning community that focuses on reading and discussing technical books. I think being able to maintain some level of sustained engagement with the book club will be the most important goal to focus on, to achieve that we'll need to be conscience that we're asking colleagues to contribute to something additional to their work which will probably deter some people. I think the best way to ensure we have sustained engagement is to make being involved in the book club as flexible as possible.

### What makes it flexible?
Traditionally book clubs gather every month or so to review and discuss the assigned book for that month and then decide on the next one. I think that with everything everyone already has going on in their lives reading a whole book in one month might be a lot for some people. In some book clubs all members get together each week and read a chapter together so no one falls behind, I like this approach but think using an hour or so each week of everyones work time is too much. I'd also like to include people from different timezones and its really hard to find a meeting time that will work for people all around the globe.

With all that being said here are somethings I'd like to incorporate to make it as flexible as possible:
* No meetings just discussions
* Instead of one book a month we'll start with one chapter a week
* Discussion is asynchronous with relative deadlines
* Members nomninate themselves to be eligilbe to lead discussion each week
* One random person shares their thoughts on the chapter a week
* There's always a backup person
* If you're not nominated to share you're not required to provide input

### Creating a plan
Here's the tricky part, how can we incorporate all of those mentioned points into somnething that works? Lets start by expanding on each of the points we need to make our book club flexible.

**No meetings just discussions** - Scheduled meetings for an hour or so eat up a lot of time, especially as the size of the book club grows. I believe a weekly discussion thread each week where the nominated members share their thoughts or just what they found interesting is a good place to start, from this sub discussions can continue with other readers who are interested in being involved.

**Instead of one book a month we'll start with a chapter a week** - One book a month can become quite the cognitive load with some of the topics discussed in a lot of technical books. I don't think we should be concerned with finishing a book in X amount of time but rather setting out with a number of chapters that the nominated person is comfortable with sharing their thoughts on.

**Discussion is asyncrhonous with relative deadlines** - To make discussion asynchronous we'll have the nominated reviewer for that week post their thoughts on the book by at the latest their Sunday of that week. If the reviewer doesn't expect they'll be able to write something the backup reviewer should be able to take their place and start the discussion in time.

**Members nominate themselves to be eligible to lead discussion each week** - Some weeks book club members may have more on their plate than normal, making the proccess opt-in means the people nominated share are more likely to.

**One random person shares their thoughts on the chapter(s) a week** - Ideally we have a pool of members who have nominated themselves to be eligible that week and from that pool someone is randomly chosen. The pool will be weighted based on the number of times someone has participated.

**There's always a backup person** - From our pool of nominated members a primary and backup is chosen each week with the backup having no responsibility unless the primary is unable to share their thoughts.

**If you're not nominated to share you're not required to provide input** - The only requirement is that the nominated person share their thoughts on the chapter and start the discussion, no one else is *required* to make any input. Of course everyone gets more out of it, if they contribute you the discussion.
