# A few of my upcoming SREads
I'm always looking to keep learning and deepend my understanding of all things SRE. Here are a few of the books currently sitting on my shelf due for a read. The titles are all SRE and machine learning related as recently I've taken an interest in how ML can benefit SRE, specifically in an MLOps sense.

### [Implementing Service Level Objectives - Alex Hidalgo](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/implementing-service-level/9781492076803/)
I thought this looked interesting since SLOs are such a key aspect of an SRE role and gaining a deeper understanding of different implementation practices can only be good.

### [Building Secure and Reliable Systems - Heather Adkins, Betsy Beyer, Paul Blankinship, Piotr Lewandowski, Ana Oprea, and Adam Stubblefield](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-secure-and/9781492083115/)
Security and reliability can sometimes be two sides of the same coin in todayâ€™s landscape. The questions this book raises around whether or not systems are reliable without being secure as well as the best practices it shares appear particular attractive.

### [Observability Engineering - Charity Majors, Liz Fong-Jones, and George Miranda](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/observability-engineering/9781492076438/)
Understanding what happens inside complex systems is a challenge all SREs continually face. I'm excited for a deep dive into observability and the tools used to better monitor and troubleshoot systems.

### [Designing Machine Learning Systems: An Iterative Process for Production-Ready Applications - Chip Huyen](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/)
Integrating machine learning into production systems is an area I'm both curious and eager to learn more about. I'm hoping iterative strategies in designing ML systems will be beneficial when attempting to integrate MLOps into SRE practices.

### [Building Machine Learning Powered Applications - Emmanuel Ameisen](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/)
Complementing the previous read, this book seems to offer a practical guide on constructing ML applications that not only perform but also scale reliably.

I'm looking forward to these reads as both learning opportunities and as sources of inspiration for my work. Each title offers a unique perspective, and together, they represent the multi-faceted nature of maintaining reliable, secure, and efficient systems.
